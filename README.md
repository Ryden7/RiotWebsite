# RiotWebsite
#Created by Rizwan Mohammed, Summer 2016

The Riot Website project is a small scale project I worked on in the Summer of 2016, its purpose is to allow players to quickly analyze
their opponents champions in order to identify small advantages at the highest levels of play. This application lists the Champions:
Health, Attack damage, attack ranges, move speed, armor and magic resist. It takes into account the users applied runepage to give you
the total stats of the opponents chosen character. 

Currently, the project is fully functional but needs to be polished with the addition of graphics and masteries.
